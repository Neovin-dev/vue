    <!-- Event handling in Vue is done with the v-on directive, so that we can make something happen when for example a button is clicked.
    Event handling is when HTML elements are set up to run a certain code when a certain event happens.
    Events in Vue are easy to use and will make our page truly responsive.
    Vue methods are code that can be set up to run when an event happens.
    With v-on modifiers you can describe in more detail how to react to an event. -->

    <div id="app">
        <p>{{"Moose Count: " + count}}</p>
        <button v-on:click="count++">Click me</button>
        <button v-on:click="count--">Click me</button>
        <!-- In addition to v-on and Vue methods we can use something called event modifiers to modify an event so that it for example only happens once after a page is loaded, or modify an event like 'submit' to prevent a form from being submitted. -->
