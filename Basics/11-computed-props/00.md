# Vue Computed Properties

1. Computed properties are like data properties, except they depend on other properties.
2. Computed properties are written like methods, but they do not accept any input arguments.
3. Computed properties are updated automatically when a dependency changes, while methods are called on when something happens, like with event handling for example.
4. Computed properties are used when outputting something that depends on something else.
5. Computed properties is the third configuration option in the Vue instance that we will learn. The first two configuration options we have already looked at are 'data' and 'methods'.
6. As with 'data' and 'methods' computed properties also has a reserved name in the Vue instance: 'computed'.

``` javascript
const app = Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    ...
  },
  computed: {
    ...
  },
  methods: {
    ...
  }
})

```

### Computed properties and methods are both written as functions, but they are different:

Methods runs when called from HTML, but computed properties updates automatically when a dependency change.
Computed properties are used the same way we use data properties, but they are dynamic.
